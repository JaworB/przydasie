# Warnings

Important cautions for GitHub workflow.

## Critical Warnings

1. **Force push rewrites history**
   - Collaborators must re-clone
   - Never force push to main branch
   - Use only on personal branches

2. **GitHub cache**
   - May take hours to update cached views
   - Check multiple times after cleanup

3. **Credentials in commit messages**
   - Filter won't remove them
   - Use generic commit messages

4. **Always backup**
   - Backup before rewriting history
   - Test in a copy first
