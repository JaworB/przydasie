# Introduction

Git is a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes in source code during software development.

## What is Git?

Git enables multiple developers to collaborate, maintain history, and manage different versions of a project.

## Key Features

- **Distributed**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository
- **Non-linear**: Supports parallel development via branches
- **Track changes**: Records every modification
- **Backup**: Complete history stored locally
- **Collaboration**: Remote servers sync changes
